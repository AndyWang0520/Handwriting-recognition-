# Image to Text (C)

This program is a simple C application that uses the Tesseract OCR library to convert an image containing text to text. It loads an image file, performs OCR, and outputs the extracted text.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Tesseract OCR
- Leptonica

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
      git clone https://github.com/AndyWang0520/Handwriting-recognition.git
   
2. **Build the project:**
- Make sure you have Tesseract OCR and Leptonica libraries installed on your system.
- Use a C compiler (e.g., gcc) to compile the program.

3. **Provide the image file:**
- Place the image file you want to convert to text in the repository directory.
- Update the `image_path` variable in the code with the path to your image file.

4. **Run the program:**
- Execute the compiled program to perform the image to text conversion.

5. **View the extracted text:**
- The program will display the extracted text on the console.
